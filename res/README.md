Files in this folder are for cib to use when it is run to cibify an SDK. These files eventually end up being part of library glue code or SDK. Some files will exactly be same even for different libraries but filenames will be different as that will also contain name of library. The reason the library name is added in the file name is that if a client program uses two different cibified libraries then the header inclusion should happen only from respective library. Nothing wrong will happen if that is not followed as the content of files will be same but still it can confuse some developer and some IDEs to see headers of one SDK is getting included in another.

There are reasons why macros are first undef'ed and then defined while other c++ constructs are guarded like file guard that doesn't contain library name.
