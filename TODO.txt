Improve type resolution by first trying to resolve with parent classes before owning namespace/classes.
	May need to move inheritance info to cppparser.

Bugs:
    Private overrides are bridgable. Currently they are ignored. Example: make AddRef, and Release private in IntrusiveObjTest.
    struct without protection level causes problem. Example: remove public in PtrTest.
