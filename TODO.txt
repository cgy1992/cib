Improve type resolution by first trying to resolve with parent classes before owning namespace/classes.
	May need to move inheritance info to cppparser.

Better type safety for __zz_cib_HANDLE and __zz_cib_PROXY.
	Needed for safe object creation from facade handle.

Bugs:
    Private overrides are bridgable. Currently they are ignored. Example: make AddRef, and Release private in IntrusiveObjTest.
    struct without protection level causes problem. Example: remove public in PtrTest.
