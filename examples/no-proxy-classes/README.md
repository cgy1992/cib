No Proxy
========

For simple class with standard layout having proxy class can be too much overhead and may be avoidable performance penalty that can come with proxy classes.
So, if the library author can guarentee that interenal object layout will not change between release of such class then CIB can generate glue code to use those classes directly not through proxy classes.
